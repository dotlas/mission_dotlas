# Fall 2023

In Fall 2023, we hired for both a full-time data engineer as well as part-time data scientists / data science interns. The full-time candidates attempted the [Prelims](./prelims) and then [Dotlas Odyssey](https://github.com/dotlas/dotlas-odyssey). The part-time and internship candidates attempted the standard [Mission.ipynb](./mission-fall-2023.ipynb). The prelims were made available through a timed quiz on [Testportal](https://dotlas.testportal.net).
