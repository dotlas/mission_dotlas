# Mission Dotlas Archives

This is a repository for past Mission Dotlas assignments, which test candidates on real-world data science and engineering challenges. These tasks are not only evaluative but also engaging and offer insight into Dotlas's work. Included are previous assignments, statistics, and candidate feedback. We update the assignments based on feedback and business needs, ensuring we continually refine our approach.
