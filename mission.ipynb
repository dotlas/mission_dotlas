The EDA will involve understanding the structure of the data, checking for missing values, outliers, and correlations, and identifying trends or patterns. Preprocessing will involve cleaning the data, transforming it into a suitable format, and handling missing values and outliers. These steps are crucial to ensure the quality and reliability of the data before applying statistical learning models. By conducting a thorough EDA and preprocessing, we can better understand the data and extract meaningful insights that will inform our decision-making.\n",

Each visualization and exploration should show progress in understanding the data better and contribute to telling the story of our data.

    "During the exploratory data analysis phase, it is crucial to assess the relevance and utility of each feature within the dataset. Dropping certain features (columns) may become necessary if they are deemed irrelevant or uninformative for the problem at hand. This process often involves evaluating the level of missing data, the presence of duplicate information, or the overall impact of each feature on the analysis. Similarly, removing rows from the dataset may be essential based on factors such as the presence of outliers, incomplete or erroneous data, or other inconsistencies that could impede the analysis. The overarching objective of this exercise section is to refine the dataset, ultimately arriving at a final set of features that you deem is important for your specific research question or business goal. Once this selection is made, you can confidently commit to these features, ensuring a more robust and reliable foundation for subsequent data analysis and modeling tasks."

    "> Note that the analytical questions may sometimes require converting categorical type columns that are lists or strings into numeric columns. For ex. \"Casual Dining\", \"Fine Dining\"..etc. would require you to generate a categorical encoding of 1,2..etc. For columns that contain lists like `categories`, which contain cuisine tags, a one-hot or multi-hot encoding technique may be required based on the situation. A numeric categorical encoding is required for these string or list based columns since pandas cannot (usually) automatically generate correlations or clusters based on text-based categories\n"
