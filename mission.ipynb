    "## Final Checklist üîò\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a final checklist to review your notebook, code style and general format. Adhering to these makes your notebook more showcasable, easier to grade and most importantly, your future-self will thank you.\n",
    "\n",
    "- No individual code cells are longer than 50 lines of code\n",
    "- No individual cell outputs require too many scrolls to go through\n",
    "- The entire notebook can be viewed in under 10-12 scrolls.\n",
    "- The outputs shown by this notebook are relevant. Hide or remove ad-hoc cells (ex. where you wanted to quickly preview a data or a column for something). \n",
    "- Repeatable: A gold standard is for your notebook to work the same everytime you run all cells. This ensures that there are no manual additions plagueing the functionality.\n",
    "- Display your dataframe (or at least `.info()` or `.shape`) every couple of cells so that when looking back, it's easy to follow the results rather than the logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Optional: Format your code cells using a tool like `black` or `nbqa`"
