So, while it's great to have fun with your data, let's make sure we're doing it in a systematic and purposeful way. Each visualization and exploration should show progress in understanding the data better and contribute to telling the story of our data. So let's put on our exploration hats and approach every chart and graph with a clear question in mind. By doing this, we'll uncover exciting insights and tell an engaging story about our data that even your grandma will want to hear.\n",

A numeric categorical encoding is required for these string or list based columns since pandas cannot (usually) automatically generate correlations or clusters based on text-based categories\n"
