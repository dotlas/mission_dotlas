## Overview

### About us

### The Mission

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to transform, process and analyze our dataset of **Restaurants in The State of California, USA**. Here are a few maps to get you inspired!

## Getting started

### Create a Private fork

Let's create a private fork of this repository:

- [Go to the Import a repository page on GitHub](https://github.com/new/import)
- Fill in the information as shown below:

  <p align="center">
    <img height="400" src="./assets/private_fork.png" alt="How to create a private fork" />
    <p align="center">How to create a private fork</p>
  </p>

Once the repository is created on GitHub, clone it onto your local system!

### Install Python `v3.9` or higher

- You can download it from the [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3105/)
- Or, you can install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) and run the following command in your terminal:

  ```bash
  conda create --name dotlas python=3.9 -y
  conda activate dotlas
  ```

### Install dependencies

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements
```

> You may install any additional dependencies!

### Get crackin'

Your mission's details are displayed in [mission.ipynb](./mission.ipynb).

### Learning resources

Please refer to [HELP.md](./HELP.md) for some resources to help you get acquainted with the tools you will need.

## Evaluation

### Submission

Once you're ready for evaluation, [invite us](#contact) as [private collaborators to your private fork](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository)!

### Criteria

Submissions will be judged on:

- Readability & maintainability of code
- Correctness & approach to the solution
- Use of "best practices" by adhering to the [Pythonic way](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-be-pythonic-and-why-you-should-care-188d63a5037e)

### Nice-to-have

> Incorporating the following will be marginally helpful to the graders to reduce friction in evaluating your assignment

- Do not create additional branches on your private repository with the submission. Keep all changes on the `main` branch.
- Add your answers to the same file `mission.ipynb`
- Do not delete markdown sections of `mission.ipynb`. Feel free to add as many sections for documentation or otherwise as you need but don't delete sections already present.
