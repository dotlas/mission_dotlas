## Overview

### About us

At [Dotlas](https://dotlas.com), are building a platform for optimizing & growing retail businesses through AI-driven insights. We've been refining and revamping this assignment for a while now, and we're excited to see what you can do with it! Optionally view past assignments, along with stats in the [archives](./archive/README.md)

### Install dependencies

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> You may install any additional dependencies!

### Get crackin'

Your mission's details are displayed in [mission.ipynb](./mission.ipynb).

Once the repository is created on GitHub, clone it onto your local system! You can solve the assignment from either your local system if you have Jupyter, Python and other dependencies - else you can use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) by uploading the notebook, working on it there and then downloading the notebook back from Colab for your submission.

Refer to [HELP.md](./HELP.md) for some resources to help you get acquainted with the tools you will need.

## Evaluation

### Submission

Once you're ready for evaluation, invite us as [private collaborators to your private fork](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository)!

You can invite the following github handles to review your assignment. Ensure to add all handles as collaborators:

- [`cricksmaidiene`](https://github.com/cricksmaidiene)
- [`mateomontero01`](https://github.com/mateomontero01)

### Criteria

Submissions will be judged on:

- Methodology & approach to the solution
- Readability & maintainability of code (Use of "best practices") by adhering to the [Pythonic way](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-be-pythonic-and-why-you-should-care-188d63a5037e)

### Submission Guidelines

- Do not create additional branches on your private repository with the submission. Keep all changes on the `main` branch.
- Add your answers to the same jupyter notebook file.
- Do not delete markdown sections of the jupyter notebook. Feel free to add as many sections for documentation or otherwise as you need but don't delete sections already present.
